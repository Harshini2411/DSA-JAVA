# ðŸ“˜ DSA_Java - Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet in Java

Welcome to my repository where Iâ€™m solving the **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet** in Java, one problem at a time. This sheet is a structured and comprehensive roadmap to mastering data structures and algorithms, designed by [Raj Vikramaditya (Striver)](https://takeuforward.org).

I'm solving and uploading **one or more problems daily**, and each solution is written in **Java**, with proper structure, comments, and clean code for easy understanding and revision.



## ðŸ§­ Sheet Roadmap

Striver's A2Z Sheet is divided into **18 categories**, covering everything from basic programming to advanced topics like graphs and dynamic programming.

Some key categories:
- âœ… Basics of Programming
- âœ… Arrays & Sorting
- âœ… Recursion & Backtracking
- âœ… Binary Search
- âœ… Linked List
- âœ… Stack & Queue
- âœ… Binary Trees & BST
- âœ… Greedy Algorithms
- âœ… Dynamic Programming
- âœ… Graphs
